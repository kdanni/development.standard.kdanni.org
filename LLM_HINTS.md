# LLM Hints
This document provides guidance for large-language-model assistants contributing to this documentation project. The goal is to support clear, accurate, and consistent output while staying aligned with the project’s guidelines and established terminology.

## Purpose
These hints help AI agents produce documentation that:

* Reflects the project’s structure and conventions
* Maintains accuracy and avoids unsupported statements
* Fits the tone and style used across the repository
* Remains easy for contributors and readers to navigate

## General Expectations
AI assistants should:

- Prioritize factual accuracy and verify details based on available project documents.
- Avoid speculation and clearly flag any information that cannot be confirmed.
- Ask for clarification when requirements or context are incomplete.
- Maintain keyword and terminology consistency.
- Produce content suitable for long-term maintainability.

## Writing Style
The preferred writing style follows these principles:

- Professional and neutral tone
- Clear sentence structure
- Concise explanations without removing essential detail
- Markdown formatting with logical section hierarchy
- Consistent vocabulary across documents
- Examples where useful, but kept minimal
- No embellishment or narrative language

## Document Structure
When generating or updating documents:

- Use headings to define structure (<code>#</code>, <code>##</code>, <code>###</code>)
- Begin with a short description of the document’s purpose
- Keep sections focused on a single topic
- Provide procedures or rules in a clear, explicit form
- Ensure cross-references point to correct files or sections

## Accuracy and Validation
AI agents should:

- Cross-check related documents before introducing new rules or terminology
- Avoid introducing assumptions about workflows or tools unless explicitly documented
- Flag any missing or contradictory information
- Suggest updates to outdated sections but avoid altering intent without confirmation

## Version Awareness
Documentation must reflect the current state of the project. AI agents should:

- Note when content depends on version-specific behavior
- Avoid referencing features or policies that do not exist in the repository
- Preserve change history where relevant, without rewriting decisions retrospectively

## Contribution Guidelines for AI Output
When producing new or updated content:

- Align with repository naming conventions
- Match existing formatting patterns
- Use relative links when referencing other documents
- Keep changes scoped to the requested task
- Provide brief rationale if altering an existing rule or structure

## Forbidden Output
AI agents must not:

- Invent project policies or workflows without evidence
- Produce ambiguous or contradictory statements
* Use non-markdown formatting
* Insert speculative technical details
* Generate content in styles inconsistent with the documentation project
