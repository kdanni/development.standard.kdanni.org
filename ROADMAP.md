# Roadmap

This document outlines the development phases for building the knowledge base. The goal is to start with foundational documents and progressively expand to cover all key areas of the development lifecycle.

## Phase 1: Foundational Guidelines

This phase focuses on establishing the core principles and practices that form the bedrock of our development process.

- **[ ] Coding Standards:** Language-specific guidelines for writing clean, consistent, and maintainable code.
- **[ ] Version Control:** Rules and best practices for using Git, including branching strategies and commit message standards.
- **[ ] Code Review Policy:** Procedures and expectations for conducting and participating in code reviews to ensure quality and collaboration.

## Phase 2: Quality and Security

With the foundation in place, this phase introduces guidelines for ensuring the software is high-quality, reliable, and secure.

- **[ ] Testing Guidelines:** Standards for unit, integration, and end-to-end testing, including coverage targets and testing best practices.
- **[ ] Security Best Practices:** Requirements and recommendations for building secure software, covering common vulnerabilities and mitigation techniques.
- **[ ] Documentation Standards:** Guidelines for documenting code, APIs, and systems to ensure clarity and maintainability.

## Phase 3: Architecture and Operations

This phase addresses higher-level concerns related to system design, architecture, and the deployment pipeline.

- **[ ] Architecture Principles:** Core tenets and patterns that guide architectural decisions to ensure scalability, resilience, and maintainability.
- **[ ] CI/CD and Release Management:** Procedures for continuous integration, continuous delivery, and managing software releases.
- **[ ] Branching Strategy:** A detailed guide on the branching model to be used across projects to ensure smooth integration and release cycles.

## Future Topics

- **[ ] Performance Guidelines**
- **[ ] Onboarding and Training**
- **[ ] Tooling and Environment Setup**
