## Purpose
The documents in this project aim to:

- Establish clear expectations for development practices.
- Promote consistency across teams and codebases.
- Improve collaboration and communication.
- Support onboarding by providing a single source of truth.
- Reduce ambiguity in technical and procedural decisions.

## Contents
The repository may include documents such as:

- Coding standards
- Version control rules
- Code review policies
- Documentation guidelines
- Branching strategies
- Security and compliance requirements
- Testing and quality-assurance practices
- Release and deployment procedures
- Architecture and design principles

(Actual content depends on your structure.)

## Structure
Documents are organized by topic in separate folders or files. Each document focuses on a specific area of development practice to keep the repository clear and easy to navigate.

## Current Roadmap Focus
The repository completed **Phase 2 – Content Development** and is transitioning into **Phase 3 – Review and Validation**. Draft guidelines, standards, and supporting templates now exist across every directory, and the next checkpoint focuses on formal reviews plus cross-document validation. Track detailed status, follow-up actions, and release notes in [`meta/README.md`](meta/README.md) and [`meta/RELEASE_NOTES.md`](meta/RELEASE_NOTES.md).
