# Guidelines

Use this directory for documents that shape day-to-day behavior. Each guideline should be concise,
actionable, and scoped to a single theme.

## Outline
- **Coding conventions** – Language-specific standards, formatting rules, and examples.
- **Documentation hygiene** – Requirements for README structure, changelog updates, and inline comments.
- **Collaboration etiquette** – Expectations for code reviews, async communication, and decision logs.
- **Tooling practices** – Approved linters, testing frameworks, and IDE configurations.
- **Branching and workflow guidance** – Preferred branching models, merge strategies, and release cadences.

## Minimum Content Expectations
1. State the goal of the guideline and the audience it applies to.
2. Provide prescriptive steps or checklists that teams can follow.
3. Reference related standards or policies where escalation or enforcement is defined.
