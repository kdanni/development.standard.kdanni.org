# Repository Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the major initiatives required to transform this repository into a complete knowledge base for software development guidelines, standards, and policies. Each phase contains specific goals and deliverables that build on one another.

## Phase 1 – Foundations
- Establish the repository directory structure and metadata documentation.
- Define contribution conventions and referencing guidelines.
- Draft initial outlines for each documentation category (guidelines, standards, policies, processes, templates, and references).

## Phase 2 – Content Development *(Completed)*
- Populate each category with baseline documents that reflect current organizational practices.
- Identify subject-matter experts to author or validate detailed content.
- Provide templates and checklists to streamline future contributions.
- Track execution details in the [Phase 2 Completion Plan](../meta/phase-2-plan.md) so contributors understand owners, milestones, and status.
- **Status**: All baseline documents, SME assignments, and reusable templates are published. Follow-up work for Phase 3 focuses on peer-reviewing the new guideline, standard, policy, process, and reference artifacts plus verifying cross-links documented in the [Phase 2 Release Notes](../meta/RELEASE_NOTES.md).

## Phase 3 – Review and Validation
- **Now in progress: Developing coding standards for Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, and Go.**
- Formalize review workflows, including peer review and governance checkpoints.
- Link related documents across categories to remove duplication and ensure consistency.
- Validate terminology, tooling references, and compliance dependencies.

## Phase 4 – Enablement and Adoption
- Publish onboarding and usage guides describing how to consume the knowledge base.
- Instrument feedback channels and maintenance cadences.
- Track adoption metrics and prioritize continuous improvements based on feedback.

## Milestone Schedule
| Phase | Timeframe | Primary Deliverables |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Phase 1 – Foundations | Weeks 1–2 | Directory structure, meta documentation, contribution guidelines |
| Phase 2 – Content Development | Weeks 3–6 | Draft content for all categories, reusable templates |
| Phase 3 – Review and Validation | Weeks 7–8 | Review workflows, cross-references, terminology validation |
| Phase 4 – Enablement and Adoption | Weeks 9–10 | Onboarding guide, feedback loop, adoption metrics |

## Success Metrics
- 100% of planned directories contain at least an outline or template by the end of Phase 2.
- Review and validation workflows exercised for every document before publication.
- Onboarding and adoption materials referenced in project kickoffs and retrospectives.
