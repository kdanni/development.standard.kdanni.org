# Operational Readiness and Handover Process

Provides criteria for runbook completion, monitoring and alerting readiness, SLO/SLA alignment, and joint incident/change workflows between development, operations, and vendors.

> ⚠️ **Placeholder:** Flesh out this process with triggers, RACI, environment-specific readiness checks, handover artifacts, and exit criteria. Add checklists that map to deployment, supportability, and incident response expectations plus evidence examples.
