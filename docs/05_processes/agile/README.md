# Agile Development Process

## Overview
Agile development prioritizes iterative delivery, close collaboration with stakeholders, and continuous improvement. Work is broken into small increments (sprints or flow units) that deliver user-facing value and adapt quickly to feedback.

Agile is successful only when the organization treats the backlog as a living contract between customers and the delivery team.
Every ceremony should reinforce transparency, inspect progress, and adapt priorities based on validated learning.

## Core Principles
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
- Responding to change over following a fixed plan.
- Delivering working software frequently.
- Empowered, cross-functional teams aligned to shared goals.
- Sustainable pace supported by automation, technical excellence, and psychological safety.

## Typical Cadence
1. **Product Vision & Roadmap** – establish outcomes, success metrics, and a prioritized backlog.
2. **Sprint Planning** – select backlog items, define acceptance criteria, and align on the sprint goal.
3. **Delivery Cycle** – design, build, test, and demonstrate increments of value within the sprint window.
4. **Review & Retrospective** – demo completed work to stakeholders, gather feedback, and identify improvements.
5. **Backlog Refinement** – continuously groom upcoming work for clarity and sizing.
6. **Release Management** – determine how increments roll into deployable releases (continuous delivery, release trains, or
   feature flags) and communicate availability to customers.

## Roles
| Role | Accountability |
| --- | --- |
| Product Owner | Prioritizes the backlog and clarifies value hypotheses. |
| Scrum Master / Flow Facilitator | Removes impediments, protects the team, and ensures process health. |
| Development Team | Designs, builds, tests, and documents increments end-to-end. |
| Stakeholders | Provide feedback and confirm value during reviews. |
| Agile Coach (optional) | Mentors teams on practices, metrics, and cross-team coordination. |

## Key Artifacts
- Product vision & roadmap
- Prioritized backlog (user stories, tasks)
- Sprint goals and burn-down/burn-up charts
- Definition of Done (DoD)
- Retrospective action log
- Working agreements, team charter, and capacity plan
- Release notes or changelog documenting increments of value shipped

## Success Tips
- Maintain close alignment between product strategy and sprint-level goals.
- Keep feedback loops tight with demos, shadowing, and telemetry.
- Invest in automation (tests, CI/CD) to support sustainable pace.
- Track flow metrics (cycle time, throughput, WIP limits) and review them during retrospectives.
- Protect 10–15% of capacity for quality improvements, automation, and technical debt reduction.
- Use Definition of Ready / Done checklists to keep scope small and predictable.
- Facilitate cross-team syncs for shared dependencies and treat impediments as first-class backlog items.
