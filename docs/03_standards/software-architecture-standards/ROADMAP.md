# Software Architecture Standards Roadmap

This document outlines the plan to complete the Software Architecture Standards design documents. The goal is to establish best practices for software development with a focus on modularity, workflow handling, and codebase sustainability.

## Current Status
- **Overall Progress:** Planning phase
- **Next Milestone:** Draft foundational governance documents

## Roadmap Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation & Governance
- [x] **Define Architecture Decision Records (ADR) Process**
  - Establish templates and workflows for proposing and ratifying architectural decisions.
- [x] **Create Architecture Design Document Template**
  - Define the structure for design documents (Context, Options, Decision, Consequences).
- [x] **Establish Review Process**
  - Define the process for architectural reviews and sign-offs.

### Phase 2: Modularity & Sustainability
- [x] **Document Modularity Standards**
  - Guidelines for coupling, cohesion, and interface design.
  - Strategies for separating concerns (e.g., domain vs. infrastructure).
- [ ] **Define Reference Models**
  - Document standard architectural patterns (e.g., Modular Monolith, Microservices, Layered Architecture) and when to apply them.
- [ ] **Sustainability & Codebase Health**
  - Guidelines for managing technical debt.
  - Refactoring strategies and deprecation policies.
  - Standards for code organization and directory structure.

### Phase 3: Workflow & Development Practices
- [ ] **Workflow Handling Standards**
  - Best practices for version control workflows related to architecture (e.g., monorepo vs. polyrepo strategies).
  - Integration of architectural checks into CI/CD pipelines.
- [ ] **Environment & Configuration Management**
  - Standards for configuration management and environment isolation.

### Phase 4: Quality Attributes & Technology
- [ ] **Define Quality Attribute Scenarios**
  - Measurable standards for performance, scalability, security, and reliability.
- [ ] **Technology Evaluation Framework**
  - Checklist and process for adopting new technologies or frameworks.
  - Lifecycle management for adopted technologies.

### Phase 5: Alignment & Finalization
- [ ] **Alignment Review**
  - Review standards against `docs/03_standards/coding-standards` and `docs/03_standards/enterprise-architecture-standars` to ensure consistency.
- [ ] **Final Publication**
  - Finalize and publish the complete set of Software Architecture Standards.
