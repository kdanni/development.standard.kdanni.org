# Standards

Standards define mandatory rules for technology choices, architecture, and compliance.
They should articulate the rationale behind the rule and how adherence is validated.

## Outline
- **Architecture standards** – Service boundaries, API design principles, and dependency rules.
- **Language/platform standards** – Supported language versions, frameworks, and compatibility matrices.
- **Security and compliance** – Encryption requirements, data handling classifications, and audit controls.
- **Quality gates** – Testing coverage thresholds, performance targets, and release readiness criteria.
- **Documentation of rationale** – Required sections that capture context, trade-offs, and decision records.

## Minimum Content Expectations
1. State whether the standard is mandatory or advisory and list enforcement mechanisms.
2. Provide measurable acceptance criteria or metrics.
3. Link to supporting guidelines, policies, or processes that describe implementation details.

## Baseline Documents
- [Service Architecture Standard](service-architecture-standard.md) – Defines guardrails, quality gates, and enforcement for HTTP services.
- [Performance and Scalability Standard](performance-and-scalability-standard.md) – Documents SLO expectations, instrumentation requirements, and escalation triggers.
