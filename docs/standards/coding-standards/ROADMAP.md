# Coding Standards Roadmap

This document outlines the development plan for creating and implementing coding standards for various programming languages used within the organization.

## Current Status
- **Overall Progress:** Inception
- **Next Milestone:** Draft Python Coding Standard

## Plan Overview
The development of coding standards will be approached on a per-language basis. Each language-specific standard will be developed and reviewed iteratively. The initial focus will be on Python, followed by JavaScript, TypeScript, and Go.

## Language-Specific Roadmaps

### Python
- [ ] Draft initial Python coding standard document.
- [ ] Define standards for code formatting (e.g., Black, isort).
- [ ] Specify linting rules (e.g., Pylint, Flake8).
- [ ] Document testing conventions (e.g., pytest).
- [ ] Review and finalize the Python standard.

### JavaScript
- [ ] Draft initial JavaScript coding standard document.
- [ ] Define standards for code formatting (e.g., Prettier).
- [ ] Specify linting rules (e.g., ESLint).
- [ ] Document testing conventions.
- [ ] Review and finalize the JavaScript standard.

### TypeScript
- [ ] Draft initial TypeScript coding standard document.
- [ ] Define standards for code formatting.
- [ ] Specify linting rules.
- [ ] Document testing conventions.
- [ ] Review and finalize the TypeScript standard.

### Go
- [ ] Draft initial Go coding standard document.
- [ ] Define standards for code formatting (e.g., gofmt).
- [ ] Specify linting rules (e.g., golint).
- [ ] Document testing conventions.
- [ ] Review and finalize the Go standard.
