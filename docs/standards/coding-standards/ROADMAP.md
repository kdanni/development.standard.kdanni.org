# Coding Standards Roadmap

This document outlines the development plan for creating and implementing coding standards for various programming languages used within the organization.

## Current Status
- **Overall Progress:** All language standards drafted
- **Next Milestone:** Review and finalize all standards

## Plan Overview
The development of coding standards will be approached on a per-language basis. Each language-specific standard will be developed and reviewed iteratively. The initial focus will be on Python, followed by JavaScript, TypeScript, and Go.

## Language-Specific Roadmaps

### Python
- [x] Draft initial Python coding standard document.
- [x] Define standards for code formatting (e.g., Black, isort).
- [x] Specify linting rules (e.g., Pylint, Flake8).
- [x] Document testing conventions (e.g., pytest).
- [x] Review and finalize the Python standard.

### JavaScript
- [x] Draft initial JavaScript coding standard document.
- [x] Define standards for code formatting (e.g., Prettier).
- [x] Specify linting rules (e.g., ESLint).
- [x] Document testing conventions.
- [x] Review and finalize the JavaScript standard.

### TypeScript
- [x] Draft initial TypeScript coding standard document.
- [x] Define standards for code formatting.
- [x] Specify linting rules.
- [x] Document testing conventions.
- [x] Review and finalize the TypeScript standard.

### Go
- [x] Draft initial Go coding standard document.
- [x] Define standards for code formatting (e.g., gofmt).
- [x] Specify linting rules (e.g., golint).
- [x] Document testing conventions.
- [x] Review and finalize the Go standard.
