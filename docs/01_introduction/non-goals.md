# Knowledge Base Non-Goals

This knowledge base is intentionally scoped. The following areas are out of scope:

- **Product roadmaps or feature backlogs.** Product planning lives in dedicated product management tools and repositories.
- **Team-specific procedures.** Squad-level rituals, calendars, or rotations should remain in team spaces where they can evolve independently.
- **Runbook-level service operations.** Service-specific playbooks, runbooks, and alerts belong with the service that owns them; only cross-cutting processes are captured here.
- **Legal or contractual commitments.** Binding agreements and customer contracts reside with the legal team and are not replicated in this repository.
- **Vendor- or tool-specific manuals.** This repository references standards for usage, not the authoritative manuals for each product; consult vendor documentation for those details.

If you are unsure whether new material belongs here, align it to an existing category in the table of contents or propose an update in the `meta` area before adding it.
