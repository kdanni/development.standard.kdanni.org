# Knowledge Base Introduction

## Context and Purpose
- Establishes a single, version-controlled source of truth for engineering standards, policies, processes, and templates.
- Provides durable guidance that complements, but does not replace, product-specific documentation or ad hoc team notes.
- Enables repeatable delivery across teams by aligning terminology, expectations, and review criteria.

## Target Audience
- Engineering teams responsible for designing, building, and operating services.
- Engineering managers and technical leads who govern practices and ensure compliance with standards.
- Product and program managers who need to understand delivery expectations and release readiness.
- Security, compliance, and SRE stakeholders who verify that operational and risk controls are being applied.

## How to Use This Knowledge Base
- Start with the table of contents to understand the available guidance and recommended reading order.
- Follow directory prefixes (01, 02, etc.) to navigate the canonical sequence when onboarding or revisiting practices.
- When contributing updates, align changes with the relevant category (guidelines, standards, policies, processes, references, templates) to keep the structure consistent.
