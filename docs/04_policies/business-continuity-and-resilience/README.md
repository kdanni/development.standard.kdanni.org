# Business Continuity and Resilience Policy

Sets RTO/RPO objectives, disaster recovery expectations, continuity testing standards, and dependency resiliency requirements for services delivered internally or by vendors.

> ⚠️ **Placeholder:** Extend this with scope, governance, control objectives, testing cadences, evidence requirements, and exception handling. Add mappings to continuity runbooks, DR playbooks, and observability standards to confirm RTO/RPO compliance.
