# Policies

Policies capture organization-wide rules, accountability, and escalation paths.
They explain who must comply, the scope of enforcement, and exception handling.

## Outline
- **Security policy** – Access control, incident disclosure, and credential management.
- **Release governance** – Criteria for promoting builds, freeze periods, and rollback authority.
- **Review and approval** – Required approvers for code, architecture, and infrastructure changes.
- **Risk management** – Severity classifications, mitigation planning, and acceptance criteria.
- **Exception handling** – Request workflows, approval roles, and documentation requirements.

## Minimum Content Expectations
1. Define the policy statement, scope, and audience in the opening section.
2. Detail roles/responsibilities, enforcement cadence, and reporting obligations.
3. Describe escalation or exception processes including required evidence or forms.

## Baseline Documents
- [Secure Release Policy](secure-release-policy.md) – Documents the mandatory gates, roles, and exception handling for every production deployment.
- [Change-Management Policy](change-management-policy.md) – Clarifies approvals, exception logging, and audit traceability for production changes.
- [Supply Chain Security and Dependency Management Policy](supply-chain-security-policy.md) – Establishes controls for dependency intake, version governance, repository integrity, and legal compliance.
