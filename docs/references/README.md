# References

Reference materials provide shared vocabulary and lookup tables that support all other documents.
They should stay evergreen and note the owner responsible for updates.

## Outline
- **Glossary** – Definitions of business and technical terms used throughout the repository.
- **Acronym index** – Alphabetized list of abbreviations with expansions and usage notes.
- **Technology matrices** – Supported platforms, tooling comparisons, and compatibility charts.
- **External resources** – Curated links to authoritative standards, articles, or specifications.
- **Data dictionaries** – Schema references, field-level definitions, and lineage information.

## Minimum Content Expectations
1. Explain how frequently the reference is reviewed and by whom.
2. Provide sourcing or citations for external references.
3. Include cross-links to documents that rely on the reference material.
