## Maintenance Notes
- Knowledge management reviews terms quarterly and coordinates updates with document owners.
- When new terms appear in guidelines, policies, or standards, add them here and cross-link back to the source document.
- Cite external sources (e.g., NIST, OWASP) inline when referencing authoritative definitions.
