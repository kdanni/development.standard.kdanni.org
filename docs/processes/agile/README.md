# Agile Development Process

## Overview
Agile development prioritizes iterative delivery, close collaboration with stakeholders, and continuous improvement. Work is broken into small increments (sprints or flow units) that deliver user-facing value and adapt quickly to feedback.

## Core Principles
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
- Responding to change over following a fixed plan.
- Delivering working software frequently.
- Empowered, cross-functional teams aligned to shared goals.

## Typical Cadence
1. **Product Vision & Roadmap** – establish outcomes, success metrics, and a prioritized backlog.
2. **Sprint Planning** – select backlog items, define acceptance criteria, and align on the sprint goal.
3. **Delivery Cycle** – design, build, test, and demonstrate increments of value within the sprint window.
4. **Review & Retrospective** – demo completed work to stakeholders, gather feedback, and identify improvements.
5. **Backlog Refinement** – continuously groom upcoming work for clarity and sizing.

## Roles
| Role | Accountability |
| --- | --- |
| Product Owner | Prioritizes the backlog and clarifies value hypotheses. |
| Scrum Master / Flow Facilitator | Removes impediments, protects the team, and ensures process health. |
| Development Team | Designs, builds, tests, and documents increments end-to-end. |
| Stakeholders | Provide feedback and confirm value during reviews. |

## Key Artifacts
- Product vision & roadmap
- Prioritized backlog (user stories, tasks)
- Sprint goals and burn-down/burn-up charts
- Definition of Done (DoD)
- Retrospective action log

## Success Tips
- Maintain close alignment between product strategy and sprint-level goals.
- Keep feedback loops tight with demos, shadowing, and telemetry.
- Invest in automation (tests, CI/CD) to support sustainable pace.
