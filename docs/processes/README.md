# Processes

Process documents describe how work is executed from trigger to completion.
They should provide enough detail that a new contributor can run the workflow with minimal guidance.

## Outline
- **Testing workflows** – Unit, integration, and end-to-end pipelines including sign-off criteria.
- **Deployment runbooks** – Environment promotion steps, rollback plans, and monitoring checkpoints.
- **Incident response** – Detection, triage, communication, and post-incident review activities.
- **Maintenance cadences** – Patch schedules, dependency updates, and lifecycle milestones.
- **Operational readiness** – Role matrices, prerequisite checklists, and success metrics.

## Minimum Content Expectations
1. Include a process overview, trigger, exit criteria, and responsible roles.
2. Provide step-by-step instructions supplemented with diagrams or tables when needed.
3. Link to supporting templates, policies, or standards that govern the process.

## Baseline Documents
- [Testing Workflow](testing-workflow.md) – Defines the trigger, stages, evidence collection, and escalation paths for automated test suites.
- [Deployment Runbook](deployment-runbook.md) – Details release gates, monitoring expectations, rollback procedures, and communication protocols.
- [Waterfall Development Process](waterfall/README.md) – Documents sequential delivery expectations, governance checkpoints, and required artifacts.
- [Agile Development Process](agile/README.md) – Describes iterative delivery cadences, team roles, and collaboration ceremonies.
- [Hybrid Development Process](hybrid/README.md) – Explains how to blend classic governance with Agile execution, including conflict resolution guidance.
- [Process Overview & Mapping](process-overview-and-mapping.md) – Compares the methodologies, maps roles, and aligns deliverables across the approaches.
