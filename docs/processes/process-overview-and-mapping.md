# Software Development Process Overview & Mapping

## Comparative Snapshot
| Dimension | Waterfall | Agile | Hybrid |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Planning Horizon | Up-front, multi-phase plans with fixed scope | Rolling-wave planning with prioritized backlog | Charter-level planning plus incremental roadmaps |
| Change Management | Formal change control board and baselined requirements | Product owner reprioritizes backlog continuously | Lightweight change requests tied to sprint outcomes and stage gates |
| Delivery Rhythm | Sequential phases, limited overlap | Time-boxed sprints or continuous flow | Stage gates containing iterative sprints |
| Documentation Depth | Comprehensive specifications at each phase | Lightweight artifacts focused on current increment | Dual-track: governance docs + sprint-level artifacts |
| Governance | Phase exit reviews, sign-offs, compliance audits | Servant leadership, team-level metrics | Integrated governance team aligning PMO + Agile leads |

## Role Mapping
| Role / Responsibility | Waterfall Equivalent | Agile Equivalent | Hybrid Approach |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Vision & Funding | Project Sponsor, Steering Committee | Product Sponsor, Product Owner | Executive Sponsor with Product Owner co-leading investment decisions |
| Delivery Leadership | Project Manager | Scrum Master / Delivery Lead | Program Manager partnering with Scrum Masters |
| Requirements Management | Business Analyst | Product Owner with team collaboration | Business Analyst translates charter into backlog with Product Owner |
| Technical Authority | Solution Architect | Tech Lead / Architecture Owner | Architecture Council with embedded Tech Leads |
| Quality & Testing | QA Manager, Test Leads | QA embedded in team, SDET roles | Central QA defines policy; teams automate tests in sprints |

## Deliverable Mapping
| Stage | Waterfall Documents | Agile Artifacts | Hybrid Blend |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Initiation | Business Case, Project Charter | Product Vision, Outcome Metrics | Portfolio Charter referencing OKRs and budget guardrails |
| Planning | Requirements Specification, Design Dossier | Prioritized Backlog, Sprint Goals | Charter-level requirements + backlog groomed for upcoming increments |
| Execution | Status Reports, Build Plan | Sprint Backlog, Burn-down charts | Sprint Backlog plus milestone dashboard shared with PMO |
| Verification | Test Plan, Traceability Matrix, UAT Sign-off | Automated Test Reports, Definition of Done checklist | Shared traceability linking sprint tests to compliance matrix |
| Deployment | Runbook, Training Plan, Maintenance Schedule | Release Notes, Operations Checklist | Combined release packet: runbook + sprint demo summary |

## How to Use This Mapping
1. **Identify Constraints** – Determine regulatory, contractual, or stakeholder expectations that demand Waterfall rigor.
2. **Select Delivery Cadence** – Choose Agile ceremonies (scrum, kanban) that best support collaboration and flow.
3. **Blend Roles & Artifacts** – Assign accountable owners for each row in the tables above and agree on the minimum viable documentation for each milestone.
4. **Inspect & Adapt** – Review the mapping quarterly to ensure it still balances speed, compliance, and stakeholder satisfaction.
