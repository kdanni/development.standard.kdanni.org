# Hybrid Development Process

## Why Hybrid is a Legitimate Consideration
Organizations rarely operate in a vacuum: compliance, vendor contracts, and existing governance models often demand the predictability of Waterfall, while market pressures require Agile responsiveness. A hybrid model blends the disciplined planning of traditional approaches with the adaptive delivery of Agile, enabling teams to meet regulatory obligations without sacrificing speed or learning.

Hybrid should not be treated as "Waterfall with stand-ups." It succeeds only when teams deliberately design interfaces between governance checkpoints and iterative delivery, ensuring that evidence produced in sprints satisfies the expectations of steering committees and auditors.

## Typical Conflict Between Classic and Agile Organizations
- **Governance vs. Autonomy** – Traditional PMOs expect phase gates and long-term roadmaps, whereas Agile teams rely on empowerment and emergent scope.
- **Documentation Expectations** – Waterfall stakeholders expect exhaustive specifications up front; Agile teams prefer lightweight, just-in-time documentation.
- **Funding Models** – Classic methodologies often fund entire projects at once, while Agile funding follows incremental value delivery.

These tensions lead to friction, duplicated reporting, and misaligned success metrics if left unresolved.

## The Need for an In-Between Solution
A hybrid approach creates explicit integration points: long-range plans satisfy executive oversight, while teams execute iteratively within each stage. This reduces approval delays, creates predictable checkpoints for dependent teams, and still preserves the ability to pivot based on validated learning.

Key outcomes of an effective hybrid model:
- Portfolio-level visibility into funding, risk, and milestone health.
- Teams empowered to experiment within guardrails, surfacing learnings without triggering full change-control resets.
- Traceability between backlog items, compliance requirements, and release evidence.

## Best-of-Both-World Considerations
1. **Stage Gates with Iterative Execution** – Use Waterfall-style stages (e.g., discovery, build, launch) but allow Agile sprints inside each gate to deliver incremental value.
2. **Dual-Track Documentation** – Maintain high-level artifacts (business case, architectural decision records) for governance while capturing Agile-friendly assets (user stories, DoD) for the teams.
3. **Integrated Metrics** – Combine delivery predictability metrics (earned value, milestone burndown) with Agile health indicators (cycle time, deployment frequency).
4. **Shared Roles** – Introduce liaisons such as Delivery Leads who understand both PMO expectations and Agile ceremonies.
5. **Decision Logs** – Maintain a single source of truth for scope trade-offs, risk acceptance, and deviation approvals that both PMO and teams can reference.

## Example Hybrid Workflow
1. **Portfolio Charter** – Approve objectives, guardrails, and budget (Waterfall artifact).
2. **Incremental Planning** – Break the charter into quarterly increments with prioritized backlogs (Agile practice).
3. **Sprint Delivery** – Teams execute sprints, demo to stakeholders, and update traceability.
4. **Stage Reviews** – At predefined milestones, consolidate sprint outcomes into the documents needed for compliance and funding release.
5. **Operational Readiness Review** – Confirm release plans, deployment evidence, and support training satisfy both Agile Definition of Done and Waterfall hand-off requirements.

## Governance Rhythm
| Cadence | Participants | Focus |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Weekly team ceremonies | Product Owner, Delivery Team, Scrum Master | Sprint planning, daily syncs, demos, retrospectives |
| Monthly portfolio sync | PMO, Product Leads, Architecture | Review increment goals, risks, capacity, budget consumption |
| Quarterly stage review | Executive sponsors, Compliance, Delivery Leads | Approve exit criteria, funding tranches, major scope changes |

Ensure artifacts generated in weekly ceremonies feed into the monthly and quarterly forums to avoid duplicate reporting.
