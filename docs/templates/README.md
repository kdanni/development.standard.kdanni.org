# Templates

Templates accelerate contributions by giving authors a starting point.
Each template should be reusable with minimal editing and include instructions for when to apply it.

## Outline
- **Document templates** – Boilerplates for guidelines, standards, policies, and processes.
- **Checklists** – Repeatable verification lists for releases, reviews, or readiness assessments.
- **Forms** – RFC forms, change request formats, and exception request documents.
- **Review rubrics** – Criteria used during peer reviews or audits.
- **Communication templates** – Incident updates, release notes, or stakeholder briefings.

## Minimum Content Expectations
1. Provide a brief description at the top of each template explaining its intent.
2. Include placeholder text or comments guiding authors on what to supply.
3. Cross-reference any mandatory policies or processes the template supports.
