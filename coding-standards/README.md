# Coding Standards

This section provides language-specific guidelines and best practices for writing clean, consistent, and maintainable code. The goal is to ensure that all code contributed to the project adheres to a high standard of quality.

## Language-Specific Guidelines

- **[Python](./python.md):** Style guide and best practices for Python development.
- **[JavaScript](./javascript.md):** Standards for writing clean and maintainable JavaScript code.
- **[TypeScript](./typescript.md):** Guidelines for using TypeScript effectively, including types and interfaces.
- **[Go](./go.md):** Standards for idiomatic Go code, including formatting and concurrency.

## General Best Practices

In addition to language-specific rules, we also follow a set of general best practices that apply to all code. These are covered in the roadmap for this section.
